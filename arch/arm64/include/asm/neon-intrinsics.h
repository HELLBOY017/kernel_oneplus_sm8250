/*
 * For Aarch64, there is some ambiguity in the definition of the types below
 * between the kernel and GCC itself. This is usually not a big deal, but it
 * causes trouble when including GCC's version of 'stdint.h' (this is the file
 * that gets included when you #include <stdint.h> on a -ffreestanding build).
 * As this file also gets included implicitly when including 'arm_neon.h' (the
 * NEON intrinsics support header), we need the following to work around the
 * issue if we want to use NEON intrinsics in the kernel.
