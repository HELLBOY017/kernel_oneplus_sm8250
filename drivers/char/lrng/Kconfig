	  The LRNG models an entropy source based on the timing of the

	  The IRQ entropy source is triggered every time an interrupt

	  by the LRNG is eliminated. Yet, this entropy source is

	  sources are available that supply the LRNG with entropy.

	  If you disable the IRQ entropy source, you MUST ensure
	  one or more entropy sources collectively have the
	  capability to deliver sufficient entropy with one invocation
	  at a rate compliant to the security strength of the DRNG
	  (usually 256 bits of entropy). In addition, if those

	  The LRNG IRQ ES collects entropy data during each interrupt.

	  The compression happens only when the DRNG is reseeded which is

	help
	  With this option, the LRNG built-in hash function used for
	  auxiliary pool management and prior to switching the
	  cryptographic backends is made available for ACVT. The
	  interface allows writing of the data to be hashed
	  into the interface. The read operation triggers the hash
	  operation to generate message digest.

	  The ACVT interface is available with the lrng_acvt_hash
	  debugfs file.

config LRNG_RUNTIME_MAX_WO_RESEED_CONFIG
	bool "Enable runtime configuration of max reseed threshold"

	  When enabling this option, the LRNG provides an interface
	  allowing the setting of the maximum number of DRNG generate
	  operations without a reseed that has full entropy. The
	  interface is lrng_drng.max_wo_reseed.

config LRNG_TEST_CPU_ES_COMPRESSION
	bool "Force CPU ES compression operation"
	help
	  When enabling this option, the CPU ES compression operation
	  is forced by setting an arbitrary value > 1 for the data
	  multiplier even when the CPU ES would deliver full entropy.
	  This allows testing of the compression operation. It
	  therefore forces to pull more data from the CPU ES
	  than what may be required.
