	  CPU idle is a generic framework for supporting software-controlled
	  idle processor power management.  It includes modular cross-platform
	  governors that can be swapped during runtime.

	  If you're using an ACPI-enabled platform, you should say Y here.

config CPU_IDLE_GOV_TEO
	bool "Timer events oriented (TEO) governor (for tickless systems)"
	help
	  This governor implements a simplified idle state selection method
	  focused on timer events and does not do any interactivity boosting.

	  Some workloads benefit from using it and it generally should be safe
	  to use.  Say Y here if you are not happy with the alternatives.
